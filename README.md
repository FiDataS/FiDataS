- 👋 Hi, I’m @FiDataS
- 👀 I’m interested in data engineering and software developement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data engineering on AWS and exploring ways to deal with Big Data as efficiently as possible (e.g. Partition Projection)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects - generally very open to many different projects. Currently mostly interested in data, 
      but would love to work on app or web developement in the future also. 
- 📫 Feel free to drop me a message on Linkedin
